Digesting deceit
I'm broken, faulted
And that just better for me (oh, oh)
This situation intrigues
I am assaulted
I don't know how I succeed

Bow down
Where am I now?
Somehow
A plaything at your discretion now

Pulling away this veil I see
Realize this path's not meant for me
Stripped away are all my needs
And now all that's left is forgotten

I want to be free
You won't allow it
It makes me drop to my knees (oh, oh)
What must I do to appease?
My effort's scalded
I guess I'll have to concede

Bow down
Where am I now?
Somehow
A plaything at your discretion now

Pulling away this veil I see
Realize this path's not meant for me
Stripped away are all my needs
And now all that's left is forgotten

One day I must decide if I'm worth it
Gave it life and I realized it took it
Don't feel bad for me
Don't feel sad for me
Don't feel bad for me
Don't feel sad for me

Bow down
Where am I now?
Somehow
A plaything at your discretion now

Pulling away this veil I see
Realize this path's not meant for me
Stripped away are all my needs
And now all that's left is forgotten
